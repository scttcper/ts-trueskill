TypeScript port of the [python TrueSkill package](https://github.com/sublee/trueskill) by Heungsub Lee. Passing most of the same tests.

### What's TrueSkill™
[TrueSkill](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill) is a rating system for players of a game. It was developed, patented, and trademarked by Microsoft Research and has been used on Xbox LIVE for ranking and matchmaking service. This system quantifies players’ TRUE skill points by the Bayesian inference algorithm. It also works well with any type of match rule including N:N team game or free-for-all.

### Installation
This package is built into es6 and published with typings. Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-trueskill):
```bash
npm install ts-trueskill
```

### Basic Use in Typescript

2 vs 2 example:
```typescript
import { rate, Rating, quality } from 'ts-trueskill';
const team1 = [new Rating(), new Rating()];
const team2 = [new Rating(), new Rating()];
// Assumes the first team was the winner by default
const q = quality([team1, team2]);
// q is quality of the match with the players at their current rating
const [rated1, rated2] = rate([team1, team2]); // rate also takes weights of winners or draw
// rated1 and rated2 are now arrays with updated scores from result of match

console.log(rated1.toString()) // team 1 went up in rating
// >> Rating(mu=28.108, sigma=7.774),Rating(mu=28.108, sigma=7.774)
console.log(rated2.toString()) // team 2 went down in rating
// >> Rating(mu=21.892, sigma=7.774),Rating(mu=21.892, sigma=7.774)
```

1 vs 1 example:
```typescript
import { Rating, quality_1vs1, rate_1vs1 } from 'ts-trueskill';
const r1 = new Rating(40, 4);
const r2 = new Rating(10, 4);
const q = quality_1vs1(r1, r2); // quality will be low from large difference in scores
const [new_r1, new_r2] = rate_1vs1(r1, r2); // get new ratings after r1 wins
```

### Basic Use in node
Requires node > v6
```javascript
const trueskill = require("ts-trueskill");
const team1 = [new trueskill.Rating(), new trueskill.Rating()];
const team2 = [new trueskill.Rating(), new trueskill.Rating()];
// Assumes the first team was the winner by default
const q = trueskill.quality([team1, team2]);
// q is quality of the match with the players at their current rating
const [rated1, rated2] = trueskill.rate([team1, team2]);
// rated1 and rated2 are now arrays with updated scores from result of match 
console.log(rated1.toString()) // team 1 went up in rating
// >> Rating(mu=28.108, sigma=7.774),Rating(mu=28.108, sigma=7.774)
console.log(rated2.toString()) // team 2 went down in rating
// >> Rating(mu=21.892, sigma=7.774),Rating(mu=21.892, sigma=7.774)
```
